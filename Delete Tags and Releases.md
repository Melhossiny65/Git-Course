To delete tags and releases in Git using the command line, follow these steps:

### Deleting Tags

1. **Delete a local tag**:
   ```sh
   git tag -d <tagname>
   ```

2. **Delete a remote tag**:
   ```sh
   git push origin --delete <tagname>
   ```

3. **Delete all local tags**:
   ```sh
   git tag -l | xargs git tag -d
   ```

4. **Delete all remote tags**:
   ```sh
   git tag -l | xargs -n 1 git push --delete origin
   ```

### Deleting Releases

Git itself does not have a concept of "releases" as it's just a version control system. Releases are usually managed on hosting services like GitHub, GitLab, etc. Hereâ€™s how to delete releases using the GitHub CLI:

1. **Install GitHub CLI** (if not already installed):
   ```sh
   gh --version
   ```

2. **Authenticate with GitHub**:
   ```sh
   gh auth login
   ```

3. **List releases**:
   ```sh
   gh release list
   ```

4. **Delete a release**:
   ```sh
   gh release delete <release-tag>
   ```

5. **Delete all releases** (if you have a lot and want to automate):
   ```sh
   for release in $(gh release list | awk '{print $1}'); do
     gh release delete $release -y
   done
   ```

### Example Workflow

1. **Delete a specific tag locally and remotely**:
   ```sh
   git tag -d v1.0.0
   git push origin --delete v1.0.0
   ```

2. **Delete all tags locally and remotely**:
   ```sh
   git tag -l | xargs git tag -d
   git tag -l | xargs -n 1 git push --delete origin
   ```

3. **Delete a specific release on GitHub**:
   ```sh
   gh release delete v1.0.0
   ```

4. **Delete all releases on GitHub**:
   ```sh
   for release in $(gh release list | awk '{print $1}'); do
     gh release delete $release -y
   done
   ```

By following these steps, you can effectively manage and delete tags and releases in your Git repositories.
