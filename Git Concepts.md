### Git
1. **Repository (Repo)**: A directory which contains your project work, including all revisions.
2. **Commit**: A snapshot of changes made to the files in your repository.

4. **Merge**: Combining changes from different branches.
5. **Clone**: Creating a copy of a repository from a remote server to your local machine.
6. **Push**: Sending your committed changes to a remote repository.
7. **Pull**: Fetching and integrating changes from a remote repository to your local repository.
8. **Fetch**: Downloading objects and refs from another repository.
9. **Checkout**: Switching between branches or restoring working tree files.
10. **Stage (or Index)**: Preparing changes to be committed.
11. **Stash**: Temporarily shelving changes you've made so you can work on something else.
12. **Conflict**: When different changes are made to the same line of a file or when one person deletes a file that another modifies.
13. **HEAD**: The current commit your working directory points to.
14. **Tag**: A specific point in Git history that is typically used to mark release points (e.g., v1.0, v2.0).

1. **Repository (Repo)**: Similar to Git, but hosted on GitHub, which can be public or private.
2. **Fork**: Creating a personal copy of another user's repository on GitHub.
3. **Pull Request (PR)**: A request to merge your changes from your forked repository into the original repository.
4. **Issue**: A way to track tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects.
